## Why should you use pomelo?
Fast, scalable, realtime game server development is not an easy job. A good container or framework can reduce the complexity.
Unfortunately, not like web, the game server framework solution is quite rare, especially open source. Pomelo will fill this blank, providing a full solution for building game server framework.
The following are the advantages:
* The architecture is scalable. It uses multi-process, single thread runtime architecture, which has been proved in industry and  especially suitable for node.js thread model.
* Easy to use, the development model is quite similiar to web, using convention over configuration, almost zero config. The api is also easy to use.
* The framework is extensible. Based on node.js micro module principle, the core of pomelo is small. All the components, libraries and tools are individual npm modules, anyone can create their own module to extend the framework.
* The reference is quite complete, we have complete documents.Besides documents, we also provide a full open source MMO demo(html5 client), which is a far more better reference than any books.
